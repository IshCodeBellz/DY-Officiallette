## 2. Feature Overview

### 2.1 User & Storefront

- Responsive Next.js 14 (RSC) UI with Tailwind
- Home: Hero, Trending Now (time-decay score), New In, Recently Viewed
- Category & search pages: client filters (size, price), relevance sorting, plural & synonym expansion
- Product Detail: multi-image gallery, structured data JSON-LD, size variant enforcement, wishlist toggle
- Cart & Wishlist: local-first â†’ sync strategy, optimistic updates, enforced size selection
- Checkout: validation (stock, deleted, size), discount codes, idempotent order creation
- Payment: simulated flow + webhook mimic; Stripe endpoints ready for live keys

### 2.2 Admin & Operations

- Dashboard KPIs
- Products / Brands / Categories CRUD (soft-delete + SKU uniqueness)
- Orders status transitions + event log (OrderEvent)
- Discount validation engine
- Inventory alerts & movement summaries
- Social moderation queue (stubs for create/vote/report)
- Security groundwork (rate limiting scaffold, MFA schema)

### 2.3 Data & Intelligence

- ProductMetrics counters (views, detailViews, wishlists, addToCart, purchases)
- Trending score = Î£(weighted interactions) Ã— decay(Î”hours, halfLife=72)
- Search facets & analytics (term frequency, trending queries foundation)
- Review & Wishlist analytics baseline

### 2.4 Engineering Foundations

- Strict TypeScript, Prisma schema (SQLite dev / Postgres-ready)
- Event batching ingestion API
- Health endpoint & env validation
- Integration + unit tests (search expansion, trending decay, checkout)

## 3. Data Model Highlights

Key Prisma models: Product, ProductVariant, SizeVariant, ProductImage, ProductMetrics, Wishlist(+Items +Followers +Analytics), ProductReview, Order / OrderItem / PaymentRecord, DiscountCode, InventoryAlert, ProductRelation, UserBehavior, Recommendation, ReviewAnalytics.

Deferred service layers: bundles, advanced variant mgmt, review create/vote/report, relations scoring, inventory alert automation.

## 4. Algorithms & Scoring

Trending weights: views 0.5, detail 1.0, wishlist 1.3, addToCart 2.2, purchases 4.0; multiplied by time decay (72h half-life logistic). Fallback: newest products if insufficient signal.
Search relevance: basic normalization + synonym/plural expansion + field weighting (name, brand, category, tags).

## 5. Social & Engagement

Implemented: wishlists (public/private), moderation query scaffolds.
Stubbed: review create/vote/report & analytics enrichment, helpfulness scoring, escalation queue.

## 6. Testing & Quality

Automated tests cover checkout flow, search expansion, trending decay math, pricing formatting, order status transitions. Manual journey validated end-to-end.

## 7. Deployment & Operations

Environment variables (see `.env.example`). Use Postgres before scale. Add Stripe live keys + webhook signing for production. Optional: Redis for caching personalization/search.

## 8. Deferred / Stubbed Feature Activation Plan

| Feature                   | Stub Location                | Unlock Steps                                           |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Review create/vote/report | `ReviewService` static stubs | Implement CRUD + vote model + analytics updates        |
| Variant management 2.0    | `ProductManagementService`   | Replace stubs; admin variant/bundle UI                 |
| Bundles & collections     | Same                         | Link model + pricing + PDP surface                     |
| Inventory alerts engine   | Same                         | On-write checks + scheduled sweeps + alert surfaces    |
| Product relations scoring | Same                         | Generate similarity graph (views, co-purchase) + cache |
| Bulk product tools        | Same                         | CLI ingest + validation + dedupe                       |

Suggested order: Reviews â†’ Variants â†’ Relations â†’ Inventory Alerts â†’ Bundles â†’ Bulk Tools.

## 9. Security Snapshot

Idempotent checkout, session via NextAuth, planned MFA, env validation logging, rate limit scaffold. Future: CSP, CSRF, token rotation, anomaly scoring.

## 10. Contribution Guidelines

1. Schema change: migrate + document rationale.
2. New service: define interface + error modes + minimal tests.
3. Currency: only integer minor units (`priceCents`).
4. Replace stubs atomically; remove "Disabled" responses and add tests.

## 11. Quick Dev Workflow

```
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npm run prisma:seed
npm run dev
npm test
```

## 12. Known Technical Debt

- Stubs as above
- No persistent cache layer yet
- Simulated Stripe if keys absent

## 13. Glossary

| Term            | Meaning                                               |

| Decay           | Time-weighting for recency                            |
| Idempotency Key | Unique key preventing duplicate checkout side effects |

## 14. Status Summary

Core production-quality; advanced social / bundles deferred; ready for payment enablement & personalization expansion.
